## Recipe App - under construction :(


## About:
Recipe App is a react application that provides recipes based on a key word or phrase, such as "Chicken" or "Green Beans". This application uses the edamam.com API (https://developer.edamam.com/) for recipe information.


### Technologies used:
- HTML5
- SASS
- React JS
- Node JS

## Notealbe Packages used:
- express
- mongoose
- morgan
- axios
- react-bootstrap / bootstrap


### Version:
1.0.0


## Getting Started:

#### Clone this repository to your local machine.

#### Run "npm install" in the terminal both in the root directory and the client directory of the project.

#### Navigate to the config folder and fill in your mLab mongoDB database credentials,

#### Navigate back to the root directory and run "npm start",


## Usage:

#### Type in a recipie or food in the search bar.

#### The application will then check the Edamam API (https://developer.edamam.com/) for any recipies matching the name or keywords entered and display them in a grid form .


## Future Enhancements / Fixes:

#### Currently the query front end only displays the name of the recipie. I will impliment a modal on click which will contain the recipie infomation.

#### Adding a loader while querying the API
