## Recipe App - under construction :(


## About:
Recipe App is a react application that provides recipes based on a key word or phrase, such as "Chicken" or "Green Beans". This application uses the edamam.com API (https://developer.edamam.com/) for recipe information.


### Technologies used:
- HTML5
- SASS
- React JS
- Node JS

## Notealbe Packages used:

- express
- mongoose
- morgan
- axios
- react-bootstrap / bootstrap


### Version:
1.0.0





## Getting Started:

#### Clone this repository to your local machine.

#### Run "npm install" in the terminal both in the root directory and the client directory of the project.

#### Navigate to the config folder and fill in your mLab mongoDB database credentials,

#### Navigate back to the root directory and run "npm start",

## Usage:

#### Type in a transaciton entry in the form at the bottom of the application. If it is an expense, preface the value with a "-". If it's positive, type the value as normal.

#### The entry will be added to the history list. This list is collapsable.

#### To delete a transaction, hover over it until the "X" shows up and click it.

## Future Enhancements / Fixes:

#### Rotation of the caret when the accordion is opened and closed (using state).

#### Adding loaders on the front end during the database calls

#### Fix adding a transaction on mobile - not properly reading input value
